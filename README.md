## Hey friends :)

I'm James. I'm a product-focused software engineer based in London.
Currently, I'm focused on making the world's best CRM at [Attio](https://attio.com/), making devs type faster with [TypePerf.com](https://typeperf.com), and learning in public on my [personal website](https://jmulholland.com/).

#### Some assorted things I like

- TypeScript (my favourite language)
- React (my favourite library)
- Node.js (my favourite way to build a backend)
- Python (for learning AI and for small code projects)
- Functional UI (λ)
- Functional UI (happy users)
- Philosophy (which led me to programming via Logic)
